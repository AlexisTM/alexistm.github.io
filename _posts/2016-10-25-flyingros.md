[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/AlexisTM/flyingros.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/AlexisTM/flyingros)

Around the Internet of robotics, there is a lot of open-source/open-hardware projects to make an awesome flying robot : **ROS**, **MAVLink**, **PX4**, **Mavros**, **Odroid XU4**. Multiple companies uses thoses projects to make money without contributing to the community. That's why FlyingROS comes to life. To bring user an ***easy*** way to fly multicopters with all tools incorporated together.

Flying Robot Operating System is designed to be the main **OPEN-SOURCE** package for your multicopter consumer application or closed-source commercial application.
