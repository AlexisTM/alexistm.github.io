description: Development of an autonomous mower software framwork, to demonstrate Kobi's vision ability on any mower
---

The aim of this project is to make the Kobi Robotics Sotftware as versatile as possible, in order to be able to integrate any electric mower into our platform and demonstrate autonomous capabilities.

**This work included**:

* Development:
    - drivers for sensors & motor controllers (such as the Roboteq)
    - a web interface to make live demonstrations of the robot
    - the navigation stack
    - zero-copy IPC interchangeable with ROS2
    - a compile-time FSM library
    - robot behavior
    - integration of the vision system
* Supervision of the cloud platform development
